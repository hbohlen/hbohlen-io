# Story 3.2: Integrate Secrets Management

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to integrate `sops-nix` for secrets management,
**so that** I can securely deploy sensitive credentials to my servers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `sops-nix` package is added as an input to the `flake.nix`.
2. At least one encrypted secrets file is created and committed to the repository.
3. The server profile is configured to decrypt and provision a secret (e.g., a placeholder API key) during the system build.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add sops-nix to flake inputs
  - [x] Update flake.nix with sops-nix input
  - [x] Add sops-nix to server configuration imports
- [x] Generate GPG key for encryption
  - [x] Create Age key configuration in .sops.yaml
  - [x] Configure key management for secrets
- [x] Create encrypted secrets file
  - [x] Create secrets.yaml file with placeholder secrets
  - [x] Set up secrets structure for encryption
  - [x] Document encryption process
- [x] Configure server to use secrets
  - [x] Update server configuration to import sops-nix
  - [x] Configure secrets paths and permissions
  - [x] Set up automatic decryption during builds

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 successfully created a generic server profile. Now we need to add secrets management to securely handle sensitive data like API keys, database passwords, and SSH keys for server deployments.

### Source Tree Information
- `nixos/flake.nix` - Current flake inputs to extend with sops-nix
- `nixos/hosts/server/configuration.nix` - Server config to update with secrets
- `.sops.yaml` - Configuration file for sops key management (to be created)

### Technical Context
Secrets management requirements:
- Age or GPG encryption for secrets
- Automatic decryption during system build
- Secure key management
- No plaintext secrets in repository
- Support for various secret types (API keys, passwords, certificates)

### File Locations
- `nixos/flake.nix` - Updated with sops-nix input
- `.sops.yaml` - Sops configuration for key management
- `nixos/secrets/secrets.yaml` - Encrypted secrets file
- `nixos/hosts/server/configuration.nix` - Updated to use secrets

### Testing
- **Testing Standards**: Build validation with secrets decryption
- **Test file location**: N/A for secrets management
- **Test standards**: Ensure secrets can be decrypted during build
- **Testing frameworks and patterns to use**: `sops` command line tool
- **Testing requirements**: Server configuration must build with decrypted secrets
