# Story 1.1: Foundational Setup & Laptop MVP

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a version-controlled, flake-based monorepo structure in Git, a declarative disk partition scheme for the laptop using `disko`, a bootable base NixOS configuration that solves the laptop's specific hardware issues (Intel VMD, NVIDIA, battery), and a minimal `home-manager` configuration for the `hbohlen` user,
**so that** I have a reliable, reproducible, and daily-driver-ready environment on my primary mobile workstation (ASUS Laptop).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A version-controlled, flake-based monorepo structure is initialized in Git.
2. A declarative disk partition scheme for the laptop is defined using `disko`.
3. A bootable base NixOS configuration is created for the laptop, addressing Intel VMD, NVIDIA, and battery issues.
4. A minimal `home-manager` configuration is set up for the `hbohlen` user.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Initialize a Git repository for the monorepo structure. (AC: 1)
   - [x] Create `hbohlen-io/nixos/flake.nix` with basic structure.
   - [x] Add `flake.lock` to Git.
- [x] Define declarative disk partitioning for the laptop using `disko`. (AC: 2)
   - [x] Create `hbohlen-io/nixos/hosts/laptop/disko.nix`.
- [x] Create a bootable base NixOS configuration for the laptop. (AC: 3)
   - [x] Create `hbohlen-io/nixos/hosts/laptop/configuration.nix`.
   - [x] Address Intel VMD, NVIDIA, and battery issues within `configuration.nix`.
- [x] Set up a minimal `home-manager` configuration for the `hbohlen` user. (AC: 4)
   - [x] Create `hbohlen-io/nixos/users/hbohlen/home.nix`.
- [ ] Ensure all Nix code is formatted with `nixpkgs-fmt`.
- [ ] Verify the setup builds and boots in a QEMU VM.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Successfully installed NixOS on ASUS Zephyrus M16 using disko-install. Configuration has been integrated into the flake structure with all hardware-specific settings preserved (NVIDIA graphics, ASUS battery management, kernel parameters).

### Installation Process Used
The initial installation was performed using the following steps:

1. **Get Git Access:**
   ```bash
   nix-shell -p git
   ```

2. **Navigate to temp directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   ```

3. **Clone configuration repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

4. **Install using disko-install:**
   ```bash
   sudo nix run --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' \
     'github:nix-community/disko/latest#disko-install' \
     -- --write-efi-boot-entries \
     --flake .#zephyrus-m16 \
     --disk nvme0n1 /dev/nvme0n1
   ```

**Note:** The original installation used flake output `zephyrus-m16` which has been renamed to `laptop` in the integrated configuration for consistency.
