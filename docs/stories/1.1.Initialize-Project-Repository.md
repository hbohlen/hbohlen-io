# Story 1.1: Initialize Project Repository

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize a new Git repository with a flake-based structure,
**so that** I have a version-controlled foundation for all future configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Git repository is created.
2. A `flake.nix` file is created with inputs for `nixpkgs`, `home-manager`, and `disko`.
3. A basic `.gitignore` and `README.md` are present.
4. A directory structure for `hosts`, `users`, and `modules` is created.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1, 3): Initialize Git repository and create initial documentation files.
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Run `git init`.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Create a `.gitignore` file.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Create a `README.md` file within the `nixos` directory.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 4): Create the core directory structure inside a `nixos` directory as defined in the architecture.
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create the `nixos/hosts` directory.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create the `nixos/users` directory.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Create the `nixos/modules` directory.
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Create the `nixos/secrets` directory.
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Create the `nixos/scripts` directory.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 2): Create the initial `flake.nix` file.
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create `nixos/flake.nix`.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Add inputs for `nixpkgs` (version 24.05), `home-manager` (version 0.40.0), and `disko` (version 0.4.0). [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure
The project structure must adhere strictly to the `Source Tree` definition. All NixOS configuration and related files must be placed within the `nixos/` top-level directory. [Source: `docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md`]

### Tech Stack
- **NixOS / Nix**: `nixpkgs-24.05`
- **Home Manager**: `0.40.0`
- **disko**: `0.4.0`
- **Source for versions**: `[Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]`

### Coding Standards
- All Nix code must be formatted with `nixpkgs-fmt`. [Source: `docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md`]

## Testing
- **VM-First Validation**: While this initial story does not produce a bootable system, it establishes the foundation. All subsequent changes that result in a system configuration must be tested in a QEMU VM before being considered complete. [Source: `docs/architecture/11-test-strategy-and-standards.md`]

### Completion Notes List
- All tasks completed successfully.
- Skipped `nixpkgs-fmt` formatting step due to non-NixOS development environment, as approved by user.
- Applied QA feedback from the `PASS` gate review.
- Pinned `home-manager` input in `flake.nix` to version `0.40.0` for improved reproducibility.
- Expanded `nixos/README.md` to include details on the directory structure.

### File List
- `.gitignore` (modified)
- `nixos/README.md` (modified)
- `nixos/hosts` (created)
- `nixos/users` (created)
- `nixos/modules` (created)

### Review Date: 2025-09-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The initial project structure is sound and follows the architectural guidelines. The `flake.nix` file correctly initializes the required inputs. The directory structure is correct.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `nixos/flake.nix`
  - **Change**: Pinned the `disko` input to tag `v0.4.0`.
  - **Why**: To ensure reproducible builds by preventing the `disko` input from floating to the latest commit. The story specified version `0.4.0`.
  - **How**: Changed `url = "github:nix-community/disko";` to `url = "github:nix-community/disko/v0.4.0";`.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: [✓] (Note: `nixpkgs-fmt` was skipped per user request, but manual formatting is acceptable.)
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✓] (Not applicable for this story, but correctly referenced.)
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Pinned `disko` flake input to a specific version.
- [x] Consider expanding the `nixos/README.md` with more details about the repository structure and purpose.
- [x] Consider pinning the `home-manager` input to a specific tag for better reproducibility.
