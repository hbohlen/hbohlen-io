# Project Brief: Hayden's NixOS Configuration

## Executive Summary

Hayden's NixOS Configuration is a comprehensive, declarative system configuration project that transforms traditional Linux system administration into a reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure-as-code approach. The project establishes a robust foundation for personal computing across desktop, laptop, and server environments using NixOS, with a focus on automation, security, and maintainability.

**Primary Problem Solved:** Eliminates system configuration drift, simplifies hardware transitions, and provides version-controlled infrastructure management for personal computing needs.

**Target Market:** Individual developers and system administrators seeking reproducible, maintainable computing environments.

**Key Value Proposition:** Single-command system deployment with guaranteed consistency across hardware configurations, automated secrets management, and seamless hardware transitions.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points
Traditional Linux system administration suffers from:
- **Configuration Drift:** Manual system changes accumulate over time, making systems difficult to reproduce or migrate
- **Hardware Transition Complexity:** Moving between laptops, desktops, and servers requires extensive reconfiguration
- **Secrets Management Inconsistency:** Sensitive credentials are often handled inconsistently across environments
- **Package Management Fragmentation:** Different package managers and versions across systems create maintenance overhead
- **Backup and Recovery Challenges:** System state is difficult to capture and restore reliably

### Impact of the Problem
- Hours spent on system reconfiguration during hardware changes
- Risk of data loss during system migrations
- Security vulnerabilities from inconsistent secrets handling
- Reduced productivity from environment inconsistencies
- Difficulty maintaining multiple systems (laptop + desktop + server)

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
- Traditional backup tools capture state but not configuration logic
- Manual documentation becomes outdated quickly
- Container-based solutions don't address host system needs
- Configuration management tools are complex and overkill for personal use

### Urgency and Importance
As personal computing becomes more complex with multiple devices, heterogeneous hardware, and increasing security requirements, the need for reproducible system configurations becomes critical for maintaining productivity and security.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach
A comprehensive NixOS configuration system that treats system administration as software development, using declarative configuration, version control, and automated deployment.

### Key Differentiators
- **Hardware Abstraction:** Single configuration adapts to different ASUS hardware (Zephyrus laptop, Z590 desktop, server)
- **Unified Package Management:** Nix handles all software installation and configuration
- **Automated Secrets:** 1Password CLI integration for secure credential management
- **Container-Native:** Podman integration with Docker compatibility
- **CI/CD Ready:** GitHub Actions validation of configuration changes

### Solution Components
1. **Modular Configuration:** Separate modules for users, packages, hardware, and services
2. **Multi-Host Support:** Unified configuration for laptop, desktop, and server profiles
3. **Automated Deployment:** Single-command installation via disko and nixos-install
4. **Version Control:** Full git history of system configuration changes
5. **Testing Pipeline:** Automated validation of configuration syntax and logic

## Target Users
