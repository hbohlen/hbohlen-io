# NixOS Configuration Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

* Achieve a stable, bootable NixOS installation on the primary target hardware (ASUS ROG Zeyhyrus M16 laptop).
* Replicate the installation successfully on the secondary desktop machine, adapting for hardware differences.
* Expand the configuration to include modular, non-hardware-specific profiles for remote VPS servers.
* Optimize the entire process to reduce the time required to provision a new machine to under 30 minutes.

### Background Context

The core problem this project addresses is the complexity and manual effort required to maintain consistent, reproducible, and synchronized environments across multiple machines. The current manual process leads to configuration drift, making system recovery and new machine setups time-consuming and unreliable.

The proposed solution is to create a single, unified GitHub repository using the NixOS ecosystem (including Flakes, `disko`, and `home-manager`). This will serve as a single source of truth, defining the entire desired state of each system declaratively. This approach enables atomic updates, reliable rollbacks, and true reproducibility, effectively automating personal system administration and eliminating inconsistencies.

## Requirements

### Functional

1.  **FR1:** The system must generate a complete NixOS configuration from a central `flake.nix` file.
2.  **FR2:** The configuration must be modular, supporting definitions for multiple distinct hosts (e.g., laptop, desktop, servers).
3.  **FR3:** The system must manage user-level dotfiles and applications via `home-manager`, fully integrated into the main system configuration.
4.  **FR4:** The system must utilize `disko` to declaratively define and apply disk partitioning schemes for target machines.
5.  **FR5:** The configuration for the ASUS laptop must incorporate hardware-specific modules for managing battery charge limits, NVIDIA PRIME graphics, and SSD TRIM.
6.  **FR6:** The project must include an installation script that automates the deployment, validates the system state (e.g., drive mounts, user privileges), and provides detailed logging for troubleshooting.

### Non-Functional

1.  **NFR1:** The entire system configuration must be version-controlled within a single Git repository.
2.  **NFR2:** The system must support atomic updates and provide a mechanism for reliable rollbacks to any previous known-good configuration.
3.  **NFR3:** A given host configuration must be fully reproducible, allowing an identical system state to be deployed on new or existing hardware.
4.  **NFR4:** Secrets, such as API keys or private credentials, must not be stored in plaintext within the Git repository and should be managed by a dedicated solution (e.g., `sops-nix`).
5.  **NFR5:** The installation process must successfully accommodate the ASUS laptop's hardware constraints, specifically the Intel VMD controller.

## User Interface Design Goals

Not applicable for this project, as it is a system-level configuration with no graphical user interface.

## Technical Assumptions

* **Repository Structure:** **Monorepo**
* **Service Architecture:** **Declarative Configuration**
* **Testing Requirements:** The primary method of testing for the MVP will be **Build & Deploy Validation**. Post-MVP, the strategy will evolve to include **Full System VM-Based Testing** for automation.
* **Additional Assumptions:**
    * The entire system will be managed using the Nix ecosystem: **NixOS**, **Flakes**, **Disko**, and **Home Manager**.
    * The configuration repository will be hosted on **GitHub**.
    * Secrets will be managed using **`sops-nix`** or a similar dedicated tool.
