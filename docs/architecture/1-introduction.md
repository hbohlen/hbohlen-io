# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the current architecture for Hayden's NixOS Configuration project. It describes the implemented system that provides declarative, reproducible infrastructure management across desktop, laptop, and server environments. The architecture emphasizes modularity, security, and maintainability for personal computing infrastructure.

## Project Evolution
The project began as a brownfield enhancement (converting existing Ubuntu installation to NixOS) and has evolved into a comprehensive multi-host configuration system. Current implementation includes completed Epics 1-3 with Epic 4 (CI/CD automation) in planning.
