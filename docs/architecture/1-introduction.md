# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the holistic architecture for the NixOS Configuration project. It establishes the foundational principles of **modularity, reusability, and a strict separation of concerns** that will govern the declarative system. The primary goal is to create a robust, scalable blueprint that not only ensures consistency across all target machines but is also explicitly designed for safe and effective modification by AI agents.

## Starter Template or Existing Project
The project will be built from scratch. This "first-principles" approach was chosen to enforce a clean, unopinionated structure tailored precisely to the project's goals, avoiding the potential complexity or cruft from external templates. This ensures the resulting architecture is both minimal and highly intentional.
